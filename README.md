##***Guess Game***
A simple web-based number guessing game built with HTML and JavaScript.

##***Overview***
In this project, the user is prompted to enter a maximum number, and the game generates a random number between 1 and that maximum. The player must guess the number, and the game will give feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game uses prompt() for user input and a while loop for the game flow. It provides a simple and interactive experience for practicing basic JavaScript logic.

##***Features***
Prompts the user to input a maximum number for the range.
The game generates a random number between 1 and the entered maximum.
The user guesses the number and receives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Continues looping until the user guesses the number correctly.
Simple interaction using browser prompts.

##***Technologies Used***
HTML: For the basic structure of the web page (minimal here).
JavaScript: For game logic, user interaction, and generating random numbers.

##***How to Play***
Open the index.html file in your browser.
The game will prompt you to enter a maximum number for the range (e.g., 100).
The game will generate a random number between 1 and the number you entered.
You will then be asked to guess the number.
The game will provide feedback (too high, too low, or correct) after each guess.
Keep guessing until you find the correct number!
You can type quit to exit game anytime.
